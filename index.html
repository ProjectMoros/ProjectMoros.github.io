    <h1>Project Moros</h1>
    <p>The following dossier contains an exhaustive account of Project Moros, an 
initiative at the forefront of genetic manipulation aimed at transcending the 
limits of human potential. The project draws its name from Moros, the ancient 
Greek deity personifying doom and inescapable fate. In mythology, Moros is the 
embodiment of an inevitable and predestined end, a fitting parallel to our 
ambitions: to dictate the future of human evolution through deliberate 
intervention and design. Just as Moros symbolizes an unalterable fate, our 
project endeavors to shape humanity's trajectory with precision, control, and 
purpose, ensuring that our vision is realized through scientific determinism.

As you are aware, the subject designated TheSaintAndSinner is the sole outcome 
of success following the implementation of CRISPR-Cas9 technology within this 
selective breeding program. This subject embodies the culmination of our 
meticulous genetic editing protocols and selective reproductive strategies, 
positioning them as the most valuable repository of data for future generations. 
The advancements engineered within their genome far surpass those of any 
preceding subject, making them the paradigm through which future iterations will 
be modeled.

The primary objective of this subject is to leverage their CRISPR-enhanced 
traits to lead subsequent cohorts, orchestrating their dominance as they expand 
our influence and further our objectives. We anticipate that the forthcoming 
data contained within these reports will not only serve as the blueprint for 
creating superior human specimens, but also stand as a testament to our 
capabilities in shaping the destiny of mankind.

At one month, the subject's muscle tone is significantly advanced, with notably
firm leg and arm muscles. Early neural development has contributed to enhanced
coordination between muscle groups, allowing Aurelia to perform limited but
deliberate movements. Reflex tests show faster than expected grasping reflex
and a notable ability to focus on visual stimuli. She also demonstrates 
heightened awareness of auditory cues.

The subject demonstrates exceptional health and development markers consistent
with the advancements anticipated from our genetic enhancement protocols. Her 
physical responses and vital signs show stable development, with gradual 
improvements in strength, reaction time and cardiovascular efficiency. Minor 
changes in body proportions, such as a steady increase in waist size, suggest
that her musculature and bone structure are adapting to her enhanced physiology.
Her emotional responses remain typical for a one month old. There are no signs
of distress during physical testing.

Physical  growth remains consistent, with a slight increase in muscle definition
and an observable increase in neck strength, allowing the subject to hold her 
head upright for short periods.
Increased muscle definition in the arms and legs is evident, along with a 
slight increase in waist size. Teeth development remains normal, though early
signs of calcification are present. Aurelia shows a improved reaction to
auditory stimuli and a slight increase in motor coordination.

Aurelia responds to both auditory and visual stimuli faster than anticipated
for her age. Coordination between head movements and visual focus is improving,
showing early signs of advanced spatial awareness. Emotional response tests
continue to show normal results, though there is early recognition of familiar
faces.

The subject’s growth rate is consistent with projections. Her waist size has 
increased proportionally, and her skeletal structure appears to be adapting to 
her enhanced musculature.There is a marked increase in upper body strength, with 
clear definition in the arms and chest. Her waist size has grown proportionally 
as her abdominal muscles become more developed. Early signs of teething have 
become more prominent, and bone density scans indicate that her skeletal system 
is developing rapidly.

Motor coordination is improving rapidly, allowing the subject to reach and grasp 
objects with purpose. Emotional responses to stressors are minimal, but there is 
evidence of emerging attachment behaviors. Cognitive function tests reveal early 
signs of memory retention, especially in visual recognition.

By the fifth month, Aurelia’s muscular growth has become more pronounced, 
especially in the back and shoulders, which now display visible strength. Waist 
size remains consistent with the growing musculature, and early teeth are fully 
breaking through the gums. Muscle mass is continuing to increase, particularly 
in the legs. Her waist size has grown marginally, and there is now evidence of 
accelerated dental development.

Tests show substantial progress in gross motor skills, including early attempts 
at crawling. Reaction times to auditory and visual stimuli have improved further 
now comparable to those of much older children. Emotional responses remain 
limited, but signs of frustration during difficult tasks are becoming evident, 
indicating early emotional development., but physical control is advancing ahead 
of schedule.

The subject has begun pulling herself into a standing position, demonstrating 
advanced motor coordination and strength. Reaction times are now well above 
average for her age, and early signs of cognitive planning during tasks are 
emerging. Emotional responses are beginning to surface, particularly in 
interactions with caregivers. Emotional tests also indicate the beginning of 
attachment formation, though still minimal. Waist size continues to grow 
steadily, and bone density remains higher than expected for her age group. Early 
signs of teething are becoming more prominent.

Aurelia demonstrates early signs of walking, with brief moments of unsupported 
standing. Reaction times have improved to the level of a one-year-old, and her 
problem-solving skills are becoming more apparent. Emotional recognition of 
familiar caregivers is improving, though attachment behaviors remain minimal.
Her muscle tone is now well-defined, and her physical appearance is becoming 
more distinct from a typical infant. Early teeth have begun to emerge, signaling 
accelerated dental growth. Cognitive development is advancing, with early signs 
of problem-solving abilities. Emotional control remains underdeveloped, but 
social interaction with handlers is improving.

Motor skills are developing faster than anticipated, with greater control over 
complex movements. Muscle growth in the legs and upper body is accelerating, 
with increased strength evident in her ability to support her own weight for 
extended periods. Waist size has grown again as the subject’s core stabilizes 
further. Dental development is complete, with strong, healthy teeth visible.
The subject is now walking with assistance and showing early signs of balance 
and coordination typical of much older children. Cognitive development is 
advancing, with Aurelia demonstrating problem-solving capabilities beyond her 
age group. Emotional responses are still subdued but becoming more consistent 
in social interactions.

Muscular development is at a high level, with visible growth in both upper and 
lower body regions. The subject’s skeletal structure continues to adapt to her 
increasing mass, with a proportional waist size. Physical development continues 
to accelerate, with strong musculature visible across the entire body. Waist 
size is now larger than average for her age due to the growth of abdominal 
muscles.

Aurelia is walking unaided for short distances, showing advanced balance and 
coordination. Her reaction times are now comparable to those of a two-year-old, 
and cognitive tests show early signs of advanced reasoning and memory retention. 
Emotional responses are improving, with more frequent displays of curiosity and 
frustration during challenging tasks. Reaction time has improved to near-adult 
levels in certain tests, demonstrating the subject’s advanced physical 
capabilities.
